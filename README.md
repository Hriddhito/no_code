India is home to many languages, but most digital platforms and professional spaces operate primarily in English. This creates a communication gap for students and office workers who are more comfortable expressing themselves in regional languages. As a result, people hesitate to share ideas, ask questions, or collaborate, leading to exclusion and reduced unity. Existing translation tools focus on converting text but do not create a shared, inclusive communication space.
